## What & why ? 

Ketchup is the simplest of sauces. Catchup will show you that using Sauce Labs is as
simple as adding ketchup to your favourite snack.

## When ?

If you don't have a lot of experience with selenium tests (or no experience at all)
this will be the easiest way for you to get started. 

## How ?

In order to get it running, you'll need [nodejs] installed on your machine.

Once [nodejs] is installed:

```
npm install -g catchup-sauce
catchup
```
